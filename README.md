## Hi there 👋

My name is Abdurashid, and I am a Backend Developer!
I primarily work with the Go (Golang) programming language and also have experience in DevOps.
I enjoy studying application architectures and discovering new ways to optimize and improve applications. I am always striving to learn something new and develop new skills.

I am currently learning algorithms and solving problems on LeetCode — here is my profile:
https://leetcode.com/u/t1_sho0/

I also have another, larger microservices-based project written in Go (Golang). Unfortunately, it is still in development, but you can check out the code and share your advice or suggestions. I am developing it on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/t1sho0/Go_Web_Project

Here are my current technical skills:

  - Go (Golang)
  - Gin
  - GORM
  - PostgreSQL
  - Docker, Docker Compose
  - GitLab CI/CD
  - Linux
  - Bash (Shell)
  - Python
  - Aiogram
  - Django
  - Postman
